The dealer and the player will each have two cards. <br>
The player's objective is to make a hand that has more points than the dealer, but less than or equal to 21 points. <br>
The player can click the "HIT" button to receive more cards or click the "STAY" button if/when the player is content with their cards.
The player will start with $100 and each time the player wants to play $5 will be deducted from their wallet <br>
If he player wins, their money is double and $10 will be added to their wallet. If the player loses then the $5 will be lost. <br>
If the player's wallet reaches $0 then the game will be over. <br>
